Introduction to Color
Colors in CSS can be described in three different ways:
Named colors — English words that describe colors, also called keyword colors
RGB — numeric values that describe a mix of red, green, and blue
HSL — numeric values that describe a mix of hue, saturation, and lightness

These colors are exactly the same as hex, but with a different syntax and a different number system.
it’s good to choose one and be consistent throughout your CSS, 
because it’s easier to compare hex to hex and RGB to RGB.

Foreground vs Background
color - this property styles an element’s foreground color.
background-color - this property styles an element’s background color.
h1 {
  color: red;
  background-color: blue;
}
the text of the heading will appear in red, and the background of the heading will appear blue.


Hexadecimal
A hex color begins with a hash character (#) which is followed by three or six characters. 
the hexadecimal number system has 16 digits (0-15) instead of 10 (0-9) like in the standard decimal system. 
To represent 10-15, we use A-F

darkseagreen: #8FBC8F
sienna:       #A0522D
saddlebrown:  #8B4513
brown:        #A52A2A
black:        #000000 or #000
white:        #FFFFFF or #FFF
aqua:         #00FFFF or #0FF


RGB Colors
h1 {
  color: rgb(23, 45, 23);
}
The first number represents the amount of red, the second is green, and the third is blue. 


Hex and RGB
In both hex and RGB, we have three values, one for each color. Each can be one of 256 values. 
Specifically, 256 * 256 * 256 = 16,777,216. 
That is the amount of colors we can now represent.
Compare that to the roughly 140 named CSS colors!
These new colors are a lot closer to the real-life colors

Hue, Saturation, and Lightness
abbreviated as HSL

color: hsl(120, 60%, 70%);
The first number represents the degree of the hue, and can be between 0 and 360. 
The second and third numbers are percentages representing saturation and lightness respectively.

Hue is the first number. It refers to an angle on a color wheel. Red is 0 and around to 360
Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of the color. The saturation increases towards 100% 
Lightness refers to how light or dark the color is. Halfway, or 50%, is normal lightness. 
Imagine a sliding dimmer 100% lighter - 0% darker 


Opacity and Alpha
we change the opacity, or the amount of transparency, 
of some colors so that some or all of the bottom elements are visible through a covering element.

color: hsla(34, 100%, 50%, 0.1);
Use hsla instead of hsl, and four values instead of three.
The fourth value is the alpha. This last value is sometimes called opacity, decimal number from zero to one.
think of the alpha value as, “the amount of the background to mix with the foreground”


color: rgba(234, 45, 98, 0.33);
The RGB color scheme has a similar syntax for opacity, rgba. 
Again, the first three values work the same as rgb and the last value is the alpha. Here’s an example:

hex colors can also have an alpha value. 
By adding a two-digit hexadecimal value to the end of the six-digit representation
Hex opacity ranges from 00 (transparent) to FF (opaque).

Alpha can only be used with HSL, RGB, and hex colors;
color: transparent;


Review 
There are four ways to represent color in CSS:

Named colors—there are more than 140 named colors, which you can review here.

Hexadecimal or hex colors
Hexadecimal is a number system with has sixteen digits, 0 to 9 followed by “A” to “F”.
Hex values always begin with # and specify values of red, blue, and green using hexadecimal numbers such as #23F41A.
Six-digit hex values with duplicate values for each RGB value can be shorted to three digits.

RGB
RGB colors use the rgb() syntax with one value for red, one value for blue and one value for green.
RGB values range from 0 to 255 and look like this: rgb(7, 210, 50).

HSL
HSL stands for hue (the color itself), saturation (the intensity of the color), and lightness (how light or dark a color is).
Hue ranges from 0 to 360 and saturation and lightness are both represented as percentages like this: hsl(200, 20%, 50%).
You can add opacity to color in RGB and HSL by adding a fourth value, a, which is represented as a percentage.
