    <!-- BOOTSTRAP 4: GRID
        
        
        Intro to the Grid
        containers are the basis of Bootstrap’s grid. Inside containers, we nest rows as immediate children. 
    Then, nested inside rows are columns. Inside columns, we put our actual content.
    

    Bootstrap Containers
    Bootstrap uses a grid system based on CSS Flexbox 
    Using the Bootstrap grid also allows for responsive design, in other words, 
    a website’s layout can change based on the user’s screen size.
    To create a container, necessary for Bootstrap’s grid, we assign a class of "container" to a <div> like so:
        <div class="container"></div>

    If we wanted the container to take up the entire width of the screen we can assign a class of "container-fluid":
        <div class="container-fluid"></div>
    

    Rows
    Rows are nested within containers.
    we can add as many rows as we want inside a container. 
    By default, a row will take up the entire width of its parent container. 
    To create a row we assign a class of "row" to an element
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row"><p>Row 1</p></div>
        <div class="row"><p>Row 2</p></div>
        <div class="row"><p>Row 3</p></div>
    </div>
    
    
    Columns
    Columns are the immediate children of rows and store content. 
    By default, a column will take up the entire width of its parent row.
    the default behavior is for each column’s width to be readjusted to fit in the row
    At most, a row will accommodate 12 columns.
    we assign an element with the class of "col"
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col"><p>three columns on a row</p></div>
            <div class="col"><p>three columns on a row</p></div>
            <div class="col"><p>three columns on a row</p></div>
        </div>
    </div> 


    Setting Column Widths
    We can decide the width of a column by appending a hyphen and a number to the "col" class like so:
        <div class="col-8"><p>This is the width of 8 columns</p></div>

    the row still has space for 8 colums. but we can add the 4 to make it readable. 
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-8">
            <p>This is the width of 8 columns.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-4">
            <p>This has the width of 4 columns.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-3">
          <p>Left Column</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
          <p>Middle Column</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-3">
          <p>Right Column</p>
        </div>
      </div>

    
    Setting Column Width with Content inside the column.
    If we want to use the content to set a column’s width, we append "auto" to the class of the column, for example:
    <div class="col-auto">
    <p>This content determines the width of the parent column</p>
    </div>
    

    Bootstrap Breakpoints
    Bootstrap categorizes screen sizes into 5 categories or as breakpoints: extra small, small, medium, large, and extra large
    Each breakpoint has a range measured in pixels
    By using these breakpoints in combination with Bootstrap’s grid, we can customize the layout of our content for different screens.
    

    Breakpoint Naming Convention
    we can freely change the layout of our content using grid. 
    even customize how our content on the grid changes based on breakpoints
    we have to follow Bootstrap’s class naming convention.
    
    col-{breakpoint}-{width}
    <div class="col-sm-8"> </div>

    As seen before "col" refers to a column.
    {breakpoint} can be sm, md, lg, or xl. Notice that there is no extra small or xs breakpoint. 
        If we omit {breakpoint}, it is by default for extra small screens.
    {width} can be set from 1 to 12 and assigns a width to the column.
    
    When we set a {breakpoint}-{width}, it means that we want our column to have that set width for 
    screens that fit in the specified breakpoint range and other larger screens.


    Combining Bootstrap Classes
    we can add multiple classes to our columns for additional control over the rendering of our content.
    <div class="col-12 col-md-8 col-xl-6"></div>
    On extra small and small sized screens, the column has a width of 12 individual columns. 
    For medium and large sized screens, the column has a width of 8 individual columns. 
    Lastly, for extra large screens, the column has a width of 6 individual columns.

    
    Bootstrap 4 Grid Review   
    When in doubt, check Bootstrap’s documentation.
    There are a few required links to use Bootstrap (the CSS file and two <meta> tags)
    Bootstrap 4 has a grid system implemented using flexbox
    The grid system is made of containers, rows, and columns that work together to make a web page’s layout.
    Containers are needed to implement the grid.
    Containers hold rows which hold columns.
    Bootstrap’s grid follows a 12 column system.
    Bootstrap uses responsive design and is built around breakpoints related to device screen sizes.
    To manually set the width of a column we have to follow Bootstrap’s naming convention.
    We can add multiple classes to a column to determine how wide a column should be on specific breakpoints. 

    
    
    BOOTSTRAP 4: UTILITIES AND COMPONENTS 

    Bootstrap Utilities and Components
    Bootstrap’s utility classes can provide additional styling and components that each serve distinct purposes.


    Adding Colors
    <p class="text-primary">This text is blue!</p>
    Appending "primary" after "text" changes the text color to blue. 

    <div class="bg-success">Green! This signifies success! </div>
    The "bg" part references the element’s background and "success" changes the background color to green

    <div class="bg-success text-white">
    Alright, we want to have a green background AND change the text color to white.
    </div>



    Styling Text
    we can use Bootstrap’s text utility classes.
    <p class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase">
    This rendered text is both bold and uppercased. 
    </p>
