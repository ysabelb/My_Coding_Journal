    HTML

    <!-- Target -->
    <a href="https://.." target="_blank">The Brown Bear</a>
    
    HTML files are often stored in the same folder, as shown in the example above. If the browser is currently displaying index.html, 
    it also known that about.html and contact.html are in the same folder. 
    Because the files are stored in the same folder, we can link web pages together using a relative path.
    project-folder./about.html
    project-folder./contact.html
    project-folder./index.html
    
    <a href="./contact.html">Contact</a>
    The ./ in ./index.html tells the browser to look for the file in the current folder.
    
  
    <!-- <span> </span> ?? -->
    Its an inline container. which does not repesent anything. 
    It can be used to group elements for styling purposes( using the class or id attributes).
    It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropiate. 
    <span> </span> is very much like a <div></div> element, but div is a block element whereas span is an inline element. 

    <p>Add the 
        <span class="ingredient">basil</span>,
        <span class="ingredient">pine nuts</span>, and
        <span class="ingredient">garlic</span> to a blender and blend into a paste. 
    </p>
    
    <!-- 
    CSS
    span.ingredient {
      color: #00;
    }
    OUTPUT: all ingredients in red color font. 
    -->

  

    <p>Gradually add the <span class="ingredient">Olive Oil</span> while running the blender slowly. 
    </p>
    
    Anchor a link to am img  
    <a href="https:.." target="_blank">
    <img src="https:.." alt="A red prickly pear fruit"/>
    </a>
    
    
    Linking to Same Page
    In order to link to a target on the same page, we must give the target an id, like this:
    <p id="top">This is the top of the page!</p>
    <h1 id="bottom">This is the bottom! </h1>
    
    An id should be descriptive to make it easier to remember the purpose of a link. The target link is a string containing the # character and the target element’s id.
    <ol>
      <li><a href="#top">Top</a></li>
      <li><a href="#bottom">Bottom</a></li>
    </ol>
    
    <a href="#contact"> <img src ="https:...jpg"></a>
    
    
   
   <!-- REVIEW
    Let’s review what you’ve learned this lesson:
    
    * The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files. This lets the browser know what version of HTML to expect.
    * The <html> element will contain all of your HTML code.
    * Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head> of the page.
    * You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of the head.
    * A webpage’s title appears in a browser’s tab.
    * Anchor tags (<a>) are used to link to internal pages, external pages or content on the same page.
    * You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using <a> tags and adding ids to the elements you wish to jump to.
    * Whitespace between HTML elements helps make code easier to read while not changing how elements appear in the browser.
    * Indentation also helps make code easier to read. It makes parent-child relationships visible.
    * Comments are written in HTML using the following syntax used in this block.
