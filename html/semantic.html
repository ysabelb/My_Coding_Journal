    Review
    Let’s review some of the topics we covered throughout the lesson:

    Semantic HTML introduces meaning to a page through specific elements that provide context as to what is in between the tags.
    Semantic HTML is a modern standard and makes a website accessible for people who use screen readers to translate the webpage and improves your website’s SEO.
    <header> 
    <nav>  
    <main>  
    <footer> 
    create the basic structure of the webpage.
    <section> defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme.
    <article> holds content that makes sense on its own such as articles, blogs, comments, etc.
    <aside> contains information that is related to the main content, but not required in order to understand the dominant information.
    <figure> encapsulates all types of media.
    <figcaption> is used to describe the media in <figure>.
    <video>, <embed>, and <audio> elements are used for media files. Video can only e used for video, while embed canbe for any file, like a gi for ex.
